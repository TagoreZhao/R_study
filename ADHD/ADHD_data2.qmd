We first inspect the effect of gender:

Hypothesis 1: The impact of gender on ADHD severity
```{r}

data$Gender <- as.factor(data$Gender)

data %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Inattention = mean(Inattention, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Hyperactivity = mean(Hyperactivity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_ADHDSeverity = mean(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

ggplot(data, aes(x = Gender, y = ADHDSeverity, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "ADHD Severity by Gender",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "ADHD Severity") +
  theme_minimal()

# Check assumptions for ANOVA
# 1. Test for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test
ks.test(data$Inattention, "pnorm", mean = mean(data$Inattention, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(data$Inattention, na.rm = TRUE))
ks.test(data$Hyperactivity, "pnorm", mean = mean(data$Hyperactivity, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(data$Hyperactivity, na.rm = TRUE))
ks.test(data$ADHDSeverity, "pnorm", mean = mean(data$ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(data$ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE))

# Visualize distributions
hist(data$Inattention, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of Inattention", xlab = "Inattention", col = "blue")
qqnorm(data$Inattention)
qqline(data$Inattention, col = "red")

hist(data$Hyperactivity, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of Hyperactivity", xlab = "Hyperactivity", col = "blue")
qqnorm(data$Hyperactivity)
qqline(data$Hyperactivity, col = "red")

hist(data$ADHDSeverity, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of ADHDSeverity", xlab = "ADHDSeverity", col = "blue")
qqnorm(data$ADHDSeverity)
qqline(data$ADHDSeverity, col = "red")
```


The p-values for all three variables are much greater than 0.05, indicating no statistically significant differences in Inattention, Hyperactivity, or ADHDSeverity across gender groups. This suggests that gender does not have a significant impact on ADHD severity scores in your dataset.

Hypothesis 2: Family history of ADHD correlates with ADHD severity in children
```{r}
# Kruskal-Wallis test for ADHD Severity measures
kruskal_inattention <- kruskal.test(Inattention ~ Gender, data = data)
kruskal_hyperactivity <- kruskal.test(Hyperactivity ~ Gender, data = data)
kruskal_overall <- kruskal.test(ADHDSeverity ~ Gender, data = data)

# Display results
kruskal_inattention
kruskal_hyperactivity
kruskal_overall
```

Hypothesis 3: The relationship between parenting style and ADHD severity
Now we proceed to examine the effect of family history:
```{r}
data$FamilyADHDHistory <- as.factor(data$FamilyADHDHistory)
data %>%
  group_by(FamilyADHDHistory) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_ADHDSeverity = mean(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_ADHDSeverity = median(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

ggplot(data, aes(x = FamilyADHDHistory, y = ADHDSeverity, fill = FamilyADHDHistory)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "ADHD Severity by Family History of ADHD",
    x = "Family History of ADHD",
    y = "ADHD Severity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

wilcox_test <- wilcox.test(
  ADHDSeverity ~ FamilyADHDHistory,
  data = data,
  exact = FALSE # Use exact=FALSE for large datasets
)

wilcox_test
```
This indicates no statistically significant difference in ADHD severity scores between children with and without a family history of ADHD.

Hypothesis 4: The role of parental involvement in education in ADHD symptom severity
```{r}
data$ParentingStyle <- as.factor(data$ParentingStyle)

# Summary statistics by ParentingStyle
data %>%
  group_by(ParentingStyle) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_ADHDSeverity = mean(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_ADHDSeverity = median(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Visualize ADHD severity by ParentingStyle
ggplot(data, aes(x = ParentingStyle, y = ADHDSeverity, fill = ParentingStyle)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "ADHD Severity by Parenting Style",
    x = "Parenting Style",
    y = "ADHD Severity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Kruskal-Wallis test for ADHDSeverity by ParentingStyle
kruskal_test <- kruskal.test(ADHDSeverity ~ ParentingStyle, data = data)

# Display Kruskal-Wallis test results
kruskal_test

if (kruskal_test$p.value < 0.05) {
  dunn_test <- dunnTest(ADHDSeverity ~ ParentingStyle, data = data, method = "bonferroni")
  dunn_test
}
```
```{r}
data$ParentalInvolvement <- factor(data$ParentalInvolvement, levels = c("Low", "Moderate", "High"))

# Summary statistics for ADHD severity by parental involvement
data %>%
  group_by(ParentalInvolvement) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_ADHDSeverity = mean(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_ADHDSeverity = median(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Visualize ADHD severity by parental involvement
ggplot(data, aes(x = ParentalInvolvement, y = ADHDSeverity, fill = ParentalInvolvement)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "ADHD Severity by Parental Involvement",
    x = "Parental Involvement",
    y = "ADHD Severity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Kruskal-Wallis test for ADHDSeverity by ParentalInvolvement
kruskal_test <- kruskal.test(ADHDSeverity ~ ParentalInvolvement, data = data)

# Display Kruskal-Wallis test results
kruskal_test

# Post-hoc Dunn's test if Kruskal-Wallis is significant
if (kruskal_test$p.value < 0.05) {
  dunn_test <- dunnTest(ADHDSeverity ~ ParentalInvolvement, data = data, method = "bonferroni")
  dunn_test
}

# Spearman rank correlation for ordinal parental involvement
spearman_corr <- cor.test(
  as.numeric(data$ParentalInvolvement),
  data$ADHDSeverity,
  method = "spearman"
)

# Display Spearman correlation results
spearman_corr
```
The p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating no statistically significant differences in ADHD severity across the levels of parental involvement (Low, Moderate, High). The correlation coefficient is very close to zero, suggesting a negligible relationship between parental involvement and ADHD severity. The p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating the correlation is not statistically significant.

Hypothesis 5: Comorbid conditions influence the severity of ADHD symptoms
```{r}
data$ComorbidConditions <- as.factor(data$ComorbidConditions)

# Summary statistics for ADHD severity by comorbid conditions
data %>%
  group_by(ComorbidConditions) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_ADHDSeverity = mean(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_ADHDSeverity = median(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Visualize ADHD severity by comorbid conditions
ggplot(data, aes(x = ComorbidConditions, y = ADHDSeverity, fill = ComorbidConditions)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "ADHD Severity by Comorbid Conditions",
    x = "Comorbid Conditions",
    y = "ADHD Severity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Kruskal-Wallis test for ADHDSeverity by ComorbidConditions
kruskal_test <- kruskal.test(ADHDSeverity ~ ComorbidConditions, data = data)

# Display Kruskal-Wallis test results
kruskal_test

# Post-hoc Dunn's test if Kruskal-Wallis is significant
if (kruskal_test$p.value < 0.05) {
  dunn_test <- dunnTest(ADHDSeverity ~ ComorbidConditions, data = data, method = "bonferroni")
  dunn_test
}

```

Hypothesis 6: The influence of IQ score on ADHD severity
```{r}
spearman_corr <- cor.test(
  data$IQScore,
  data$ADHDSeverity,
  method = "spearman"
)

# Display Spearman correlation results
spearman_corr

# Fit a linear regression model
lm_model <- lm(ADHDSeverity ~ IQScore, data = data)

# Display linear regression summary
summary(lm_model)

# Visualize the relationship with a scatter plot and regression line
ggplot(data, aes(x = IQScore, y = ADHDSeverity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between IQ Score and ADHD Severity",
    x = "IQ Score",
    y = "ADHD Severity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
The correlation coefficient is very close to 0, indicating an extremely weak relationship between IQ scores and ADHD severity. The p-value (p=0.283) is greater than 0.05, suggesting that the relationship is not statistically significant.The effect size (slope) is negligible, and the model explains almost none of the variation in ADHD severity.

Hypothesis 7: Domestic violence history affects ADHD symptoms
- Test: Investigate whether a history of domestic violence in the household is
associated with more severe ADHD symptoms.
```{r}
data$DomesticViolence <- as.factor(data$DomesticViolence)

# Summary statistics for ADHD severity by domestic violence history
data %>%
  group_by(DomesticViolence) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_ADHDSeverity = mean(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_ADHDSeverity = median(ADHDSeverity, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Visualize ADHD severity by domestic violence history
ggplot(data, aes(x = DomesticViolence, y = ADHDSeverity, fill = DomesticViolence)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "ADHD Severity by Domestic Violence History",
    x = "Domestic Violence History",
    y = "ADHD Severity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U Test) for ADHDSeverity
wilcox_test_dv <- wilcox.test(
  ADHDSeverity ~ DomesticViolence,
  data = data,
  exact = FALSE
)

# Display Wilcoxon test results
wilcox_test_dv
```

Hypothesis 8: The effect of school type (private vs public) on teacher ratings
of behavior
- Test: Compare teacher ratings of behavior between students attending 
private and public schools to see if school type impacts behavioral 
assessments.
```{r}
# Ensure SchoolType is a factor
data$SchoolType <- as.factor(data$SchoolType)

# Summary statistics for teacher ratings by school type
data %>%
  group_by(SchoolType) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_TeacherRating = mean(TeacherRating, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_TeacherRating = median(TeacherRating, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Visualize teacher ratings by school type
ggplot(data, aes(x = SchoolType, y = TeacherRating, fill = SchoolType)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Teacher Ratings by School Type",
    x = "School Type",
    y = "Teacher Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U Test) for TeacherRating
wilcox_test_school <- wilcox.test(
  TeacherRating ~ SchoolType,
  data = data,
  exact = FALSE
)

# Display Wilcoxon test results
wilcox_test_school

```

Hypothesis 9: Number of siblings affects ADHD symptoms
- Test: Examine if having more or fewer siblings is associated with changes in
ADHD symptom severity or social skills assessments
```{r}
# Spearman's rank correlation for NumSiblings and ADHDSeverity
spearman_corr_adhd <- cor.test(
  data$NumSiblings,
  data$ADHDSeverity,
  method = "spearman"
)

# Spearman's rank correlation for NumSiblings and SocialSkills
spearman_corr_social <- cor.test(
  data$NumSiblings,
  data$SocialSkills,
  method = "spearman"
)

# Display Spearman correlation results
spearman_corr_adhd
spearman_corr_social

# Linear regression for NumSiblings predicting ADHDSeverity
lm_adhd <- lm(ADHDSeverity ~ NumSiblings, data = data)
summary(lm_adhd)

# Linear regression for NumSiblings predicting SocialSkills
lm_social <- lm(SocialSkills ~ NumSiblings, data = data)
summary(lm_social)

# Visualization: NumSiblings vs ADHDSeverity
ggplot(data, aes(x = NumSiblings, y = ADHDSeverity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Number of Siblings and ADHD Severity",
    x = "Number of Siblings",
    y = "ADHD Severity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Visualization: NumSiblings vs SocialSkills
ggplot(data, aes(x = NumSiblings, y = SocialSkills)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "green") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Number of Siblings and Social Skills",
    x = "Number of Siblings",
    y = "Social Skills"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
